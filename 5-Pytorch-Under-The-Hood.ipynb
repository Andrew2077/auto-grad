    "## Tensors\n",
    "- Tensors are special types of arrays that were created to optimize deep learning calculations.\n",
    "- Tensors are similar to NumPyâ€™s ndarrays, except that tensors can run on GPUs or other hardware accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensor Attributes\n",
    "- Tensor attributes describe their shape, datatype, and the device on which they are stored.\n",
    "- Tensor attributes are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensor Operations\n",
    "- Once a tensor is instantiated, it's first shape stored in the memroy is contiguously.\n",
    "  - This means that the tensor is stored in a contiguous block of memory.\n",
    "  - and you can only manipulate the shape of the tensor by changing the stride.\n",
    "    - stride means how do you access the next element in the tensor.\n",
    "  - This is why tensor operations are so fast and efficient."
